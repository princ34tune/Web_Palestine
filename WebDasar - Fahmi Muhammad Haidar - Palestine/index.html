      <p>Don't stop talking about Palestine. The cursed State of Israel attacks Palestine in a barbaric and inhumane way. Those who colonized Palestine were only immigrants and did not own the land.</p>

      <p>As an example, if a robber visits your house, the robber says that your house belongs to his ancestors and when you try to reclaim your house, you are chased away by the crowd and the people believe that the house that was originally yours is not yours.</p>
      <p>Let's stop all these conflicts and let's liberate Palestine</p>
